    "A2. Python supports different ways of writing programs, known as programming paradigms. Here are the main programming paradigms supported by Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Procedural Programming**: Python lets you write programs using procedures or functions that perform specific tasks step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Python has strong support for OOP, allowing you to create classes and objects to model real-world entities. It includes features like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Functional Programming**: Python supports functional programming concepts such as using functions as first-class citizens, lambda expressions, and functional-style operations like map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Imperative Programming**: In Python, you can write programs in an imperative style, where statements are executed sequentially to change the program's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Declarative Programming**: While not fully declarative, Python supports some declarative aspects, especially with libraries like Pandas (for data manipulation) and SQLalchemy (for database operations) that allow you to express operations in a declarative manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's support for these paradigms gives developers the flexibility to choose the approach that best suits their programming needs."
